# =============== OPTIONAL: AUDIO CONVERSION ===============
# For faster gTTS playback (convert MP3 to WAV)
# Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
# Then add to PATH or install via:
# Windows: choco install ffmpeg
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg

# =============== INSTALLATION GUIDE ===============
# 
# STEP 1: Install Python 3.10+ from python.org
#
# STEP 2: Install dependencies
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# STEP 3: Install system dependencies
#
#   PYAUDIO (REQUIRED for microphone):
#   Windows: pip install pipwin && pipwin install pyaudio
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
#   macOS: brew install portaudio && pip install pyaudio
#
#   TESSERACT OCR (OPTIONAL for screen reading):
#   Windows: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
#   macOS: brew install tesseract
#
#   FFMPEG (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED for gTTS speed):
#   Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html (or choco install ffmpeg)
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
#   macOS: brew install ffmpeg
#
#   VLC MEDIA PLAYER (REQUIRED for animations):
#   Windows: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install vlc
#   macOS: brew install vlc
#
# STEP 4: Download Vosk offline model (REQUIRED for offline voice)
#   Download: vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph
#   From: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
#   Extract to: robin/ folder (same directory as robin.py)
#
# STEP 5: Create config.py
#   OPENAI_API_KEYS = ["sk-your-api-key-1", "sk-your-api-key-2"]
#
# STEP 6: Create images/emotions/ folder with MP4 files
#   Directory structure:
#   robin/
#   ├── robin.py
#   ├── config.py
#   ├── requirements.txt
#   ├── vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph/
#   └── images/
#       └── emotions/
#           ├── normal.mp4
#           ├── happy.mp4
#           ├── sad.mp4
#           └── ...
#
# STEP 7: Run Robin
#   python robin.py

# =============== TROUBLESHOOTING ===============
#
# gTTS Taking Too Long?
#   - Make sure ffmpeg is installed (speeds up MP3→WAV conversion)
#   - Use .co.in TLD instead of .com for faster response
#   - First load always takes longer (network latency)
#   - Subsequent requests are cached and faster
#
# Vosk Not Working?
#   - Verify model path: vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph
#   - Model should be in same folder as robin.py
#   - Check microphone is working: test with Google Speech Recognition first
#   - Vosk works offline but may be slower than online
#
# No Sound/Microphone?
#   - Install pyaudio properly (see STEP 3)
#   - Check microphone in Windows Sound Settings
#   - Test microphone on another application first
#
# PyTTSx3 Issues?
#   - On Windows, should use built-in voices automatically
#   - On Linux/Mac, install espeak: apt-get install espeak
#
# Performance Issues?
#   - Close other audio applications
#   - Disable animations if CPU usage is high
#   - Use PyTTSx3 instead of gTTS for offline mode
#
# =============== RECOMMENDED SETUP ===============
#
# For BEST performance with Vosk + gTTS:
# ✓ Windows 10/11, Python 3.10+
# ✓ ffmpeg installed (for fast audio conversion)
# ✓ Good microphone (USB if possible)
# ✓ Internet connection for gTTS (fallback to PyTTSx3 offline)
# ✓ At least 4GB RAM for smooth operation
